Small8 assembler

Generates .mif files from .asm files that are identical to provided pairs in class.

Add a .asm file (or multiple) in this directory and then run `make`.

Run `make test` to verify that class provided test pairs assemble and match.

To get started, run:

    cp test/TestCase1.asm my_program.asm
    make
